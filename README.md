# Gender Balance among Graduates of UGC-funded Programmes

Annually, 28'500 students graduate from programs funded by the [University Grants Committee](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/index.html) (UGC). The mission of the UGC is to nurture high-quality people to promote the economic and social development of Hong Kong. Are male and female students equally represented among the graduates who will build the future of Hong-Kong?

Using open data found on [data.gov.hk](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-ugc-ugc-student-graduates2), I explore the gender balance by _academic year_, _level of study_ and _Academic Programme Category_.  

The results are presented in a Shiny app, so that everyone can explore the data. Key observations and actionable insights for decision-makers are also highlighted.

The app is deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://delavyz.shinyapps.io/gender_balance_UGC_graduates/).
