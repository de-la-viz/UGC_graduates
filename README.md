# UGC_graduates

Every year some 28'500 students graduate from programmes funded by the [University Grants Committee](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/index.html) (UGC) in Hong Kong. Are male and female students equally represented among the graduates?  

Using open data found on [data.gov.hk](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-ugc-ugc-student-graduates2), I explore the gender balance by _academic year_, _level of study_ and _Academic Programme Category_.  

The results are presented in a Shiny app, so that everyone can explore the data. Key observations are also documented.  

The app is deployed [there](tbd).
